# Test openface on Amazon EC2 Linux Instance

[Openface](https://cmusatyalab.github.io/openface/) provide free and open source face recognition with deep neural networks.

1. Create Amazon EC2 Linux Instance.
2. Install docker on that instance follow http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/docker-basics.html#install_docker.
3. Pull preconfigured docker image for openface and then start it:
    docker pull bamos/openface
    docker run -p 9000:9000 -p 8000:8000 -t -i bamos/openface /bin/bash
4. Make a folder called ./training_images/ inside the openface folder(/root/openface).
    mkdir training_images
   Make a subfolder for each person you want to recognize. For example:
    mkdir ./training_images/obama/
    mkdir ./training_images/trump/
5. Copy all your images of each person into the correct sub-folders. Make sure only one face appears in each image. There's no need to crop the image around the face. OpenFace will do that automatically.
